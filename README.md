# Facial Emotion Recognition with Deep Learning

 **This project was developed as a mandatory project of Applied Data Science Program of Massachusetts Institute of Technology**

## **Problem Definition**

**The context:** Why is this problem important to solve? The main reason why this problem is important to solve has a base in technology and security. Facial recognition can make security of various places (like aerports and offices) more productive and safe. The recognition of faces and their expressions can make the crime rate to decrease because of the ratio of achievment at the moment of preventing crime, only if there are security cameras available.  <br>
**The objectives:** What is the intended goal? The facial recognition of various emotions.<br>
**The key questions:** What are the key questions that need to be answered?
* Which is the one model that recognizes facial expressions with high perfomance ratio?
* Is it a facial expression difficult to recognize?<br>
**The problem formulation:** What are we trying to solve using data science? What we are trying to solve with data science is done by the development of neural networks for facial recognition. By applying various models comparisions can be made. What we are trying to solve is the recognition of patterns in the different facial expressions made by humans.



## **About the dataset**

The data set consists of 3 folders, i.e., 'test', 'train', and 'validation'.
Each of these folders has four subfolders:

**‘happy’**: Images of people who have happy facial expressions.<br>
**‘sad’**: Images of people with sad or upset facial expressions.<br>
**‘surprise’**: Images of people who have shocked or surprised facial expressions.<br>
**‘neutral’**: Images of people showing no prominent emotion in their facial expression at all.<br>
